# Project Overview

Graph Sudoku is an application which was created with three goals in mind:
- Teach myself Jetpack Compose
- Teach myself Graph Datastructure & Algorithms (Directed Colored Graph)
- Build a simple and fun app

It uses my general purpose software architecture (model-view-nobody-gives-a-****) which is basically just applied separation of concerns.

# DS & Algos

The algorithms in here were written by **Ryan BracketCove**. I do not learn well at all from textbooks, so apart from spending a week trying to understand what an Adjacency List was, I start making this application.

The only part that I am particularly proud of, is I'm able to make this app.
